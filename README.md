# Website
New website with better UI written in Django.

## Usage
By default every time you start the server with `python pitv/manage.py runserver` it uses different key. In order to change that, make `local_settings.py` in `pitv/pitv/`

## Contributing
Feel free to open issue or pull request.  
Usually `grep  -i "TODO" -r .` will reveal things that should be changed
